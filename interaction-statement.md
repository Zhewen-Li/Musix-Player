# Interaction Statement

The interaction I used in my music displayer was mostly mouse and key operations.

INDEX PAGE:
    1. At the first page, which is the index page of my music displayer, hold pressing the question mark, and the introduction will be displayed. 
    2. To initialize the game, click anywhere of the screen, the whole displayer starts.

As I mentioned in the artist-statement, the whole displayer was consisted of three parts: stage one: choose music, stage two: choose style, and finally, show the displayer.

STAGE ONE: CHOOSE MUSIC:
    1. Click on the notes to hear the music.
    2. Click each bar to fix the current selected music. (If one is chosen, the bar will show a deeper color --- call it bar-lighting)
    3. Click 'next' button to the next stage. 

STAGE TWO: CHOOSE STYLE:
    1. Click on the play button(a rectangle with a triangle inside) to preview the style
        (*) style 3 is a type that based on mouse movement, visitors are free to move over the screen.
    2. Click on each cirlce to fix the current selected music. (If one is chosen, the circle will show the content --- call it circle-lighting)
    3. Click 'next' button to the next stage.
