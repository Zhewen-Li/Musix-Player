# Artist Statement

The interactive p5 artwork I created was both a music mixer and a music displayer, so it is called 'Musix-Player'. I'd like to bring viewers a new music experience through this artwork. 

/* Theme */ 
The theme is 'new', and this 'new' is reflected in three aspects in my artwork. 
First, in audioty aspects, as I mentioned, it is a muisc mixer. During the process, based on the original music, viewers can create new styles of music by adding other instrument sound effects. (I used drums for my displayer. )
Second, in visual aspects, viewers can pick different visualising styles for displaying music, or even make their own version of visualising style by mouse movement to create a new displaying form of music. (style 3, the displaying points are generated according to mouse positons). 
Third, the outcome created from the previous two stages contributes to a new form of musical expression, which is the final stage of 'Musix-Player'. Viewers can enjoy their freestyle while the music is playing.

/* Structure*/ 
The 'Musix-Player' is combined with 5 parts: an index page, stage for choosing music, stage for choose displaying style, transition page, and the final stage.

Index page:
    It is the home page for 'Musix-Player', it will show viewers a breif introduction according to mouse operations.

Stage for choosing music:
    This is the first stage of 'Musix-Player', which is created for choosing one piece of music from the five presented as the original music. Further changes(adding sound effects) will be made based on the music selected during this stage. Feel free to pre-listen the music before selecting. 
    All five musics are light musics which are more suitable to add sound effects on that basis. Three of them are quiet and slow while the other two are lively, so as to fit viewers' different taste of music.

Speaking of style, the displaying form should be explained first. As a music displayer, things that will be shown on the final stage are a set of shapes that blink according to the amplitude of the music, which looks like they are breathing with the music. 

Stage for choosing style:
    This is the second stage of 'Musix-Player', which is created for choosing one displaying style from the three presented as the original style. Further changes(change colors or shapes)will be made based on the style selected during this stage. Also, viewers can take a preview of each style before selecting.
    Both style 1 and style 2 are fixed form style, which means the points generating for the displayer have fixed routes. Style 3 is controlled by viewers mouse movement, so it gives more freedom and fun for viewers to create unique patterns.

Stage for transition page:
    This is a page that tells some important instructions before the final stage shows.

Final stage:
    It is time for viewers to enjoy their music combined with the style they picked. During playing, viewers can do some music mixing by key operations, while change displaying color by mouse movement over the screen. 


/* Thoughts */
I hope this 'Musix-Player' can give viewers a brand-new music experience. While viewers listen to a piece of music, they can participate in the rhythm of music through 'Musix-Player'. By adding other sound effects, selecting or drawing a type of music visualization for one's own taste, so that viewers can experience the process of adaptating music, enjoying the joy of creating. Through 'Musix-Player', I expect viewers to get a better feeling for music, experiencing the creative process and feeling the pleasure of relaxation. 
So, when they get out of the gallery, I hope that they will have great fun and can recommend 'Musix-Player' to others for its creativity, and the joy it brings.
